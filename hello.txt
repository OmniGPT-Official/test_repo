Agentic engineering is the practice of designing, building, and managing AI agents that can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to accomplish complex goals over time. It goes beyond single-turn model interactions and focuses on constructing systems where agents can plan, reason, remember, use tools, and adapt based on outcomes and feedback. At its core, agentic engineering blends AI model capabilities with robust software engineering principles such as state management, error handling, observability, and safety controls.

A central aspect of agentic engineering is workflow design and orchestration. This involves breaking high-level objectives into structured, repeatable steps and coordinating how agents move between them—such as intent detection, planning, execution, validation, and escalation. Orchestration defines when an agent should act, pause, delegate to another agent, call external tools or APIs, request human input, or terminate a process. Well-designed workflows ensure reliability, prevent infinite loops, manage dependencies, and enable agents to handle multi-step tasks across systems like databases, CRMs, payment platforms, or messaging channels.

Agentic engineering also emphasizes control and alignment through guardrails, policies, and evaluation layers. These include constraints on actions, confidence thresholds, fallback logic, and continuous monitoring to ensure agents behave predictably and safely in production. By combining intelligent decision-making with clearly defined workflows and orchestration logic, agentic engineering enables scalable, maintainable AI systems that can operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments.
