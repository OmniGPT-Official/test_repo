Agentic engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and operating autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents that can perceive context, make decisions, and take actions to achieve defined goals.  Rather than prompting models for single responses, agentic engineering focuses on workflows, guardrails, state management, and evaluation—ensuring agents act safely, adapt over time, and deliver consistent outcomes in real-world applications.
